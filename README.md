Api Work - An introduction to APIs. As always, consult the documentation before trying to make API calls. Here, we are working with the World Bank. Construct a response through a request.get with the URL in a .json(). It is advisable to print the jsonified response using .dumps(). The goal is to get a list of each Lending type. Traverse the index and use a list comprehension to extract the necessary values. Now that we have a list of the lending types, we create an empty array and construct a loop that queries the World Bank data using each lending type in the query. In the response, there is an array which has a key-value pair which contains the total amount of countries that use that specific lending type. Append this value to the array.

Twitter Sentiment - This is an introduction to Vader Sentiment Analysis and Tweepy. After importing depencies and the sentiment analyzer, the next step is to instantiate a Tweepy API call. We create a list of the 5 twitter handles we wish to observe and loop through each, pulling the last 100 tweets from each account and create a DataFrame that houses all of them. We assign each tweet per handle an index value 1-100.
