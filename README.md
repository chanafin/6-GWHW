Api Work - An introduction to APIs. As always, consult the documentation before trying to make API calls. Here, we are working with the World Bank. Construct a response through a request.get with the URL in a .json(). It is advisable to print the jsonified response using .dumps(). The goal is to get a list of each Lending type. Traverse the index and use a list comprehension to extract the necessary values. Now that we have a list of the lending types, we create an empty array and construct a loop that queries the World Bank data using each lending type. In the response, there is an array which has a key-value pair that contains the amount of countries that use that specific lending type. Append this value to the array.
